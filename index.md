# My perspective on Quantum Chemistry

\tableofcontents <!-- you can use \toc as well -->

I am a chemist who believes in the power of physics to explain chemical bonding. If we rely on a quote from Servos in his book about *Modern Chemistry is in need of reform*, while talking about Ostwald: 

> Every science, Ostwald thought, progressed three distinguishable stages. The first consisted of discovering and describing a set of phenomena; the second, of arranging those phenomena into orderly categories; and the third, of determining the general laws to which phenomena were subject. Physics had entered the third stage, chemistry had not.

We need a clear distinction of chemical properties from first physical principles in order to obtain a clear definition of chemical bonding. This is the main goal of this website.

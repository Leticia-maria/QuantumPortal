If we rely on a quote from Servos in his book about <em>Modern Chemistry is in need of reform</em>, while talking about Ostwald: </p> <blockquote> <p>Every science, Ostwald thought, progressed three distinguishable stages. The first consisted of discovering and describing a set of phenomena; the second, of arranging those phenomena into orderly categories; and the third, of determining the general laws to which phenomena were subject. Physics had entered the third stage, chemistry had not.</p> </blockquote> <p>We need a clear distinction of chemical properties from first physical principles in order to obtain a clear definition of chemical bonding. This is the main goal of this website, and you can see it stated more clearly in this quote from Kant:</p> <blockquote> <p>After all, there is nothing extraordinary in the elaboration of science that, when men begin to wonder how fat it has advanced, the question should at last occur whether and how such a science is possible at all. Human reason so delights building that it has several times built up a tower and then razed it to see how the foundation was laid. It is never too late to become reasonable and wise; but if the knowledge comes late, there is always more difficulty in starting a reform. &#40;Kant, 1783&#41;</p> </blockquote> <div class=page-foot > <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> Leticia Madureira.
